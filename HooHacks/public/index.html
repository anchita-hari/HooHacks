            <h2>Mission Statement</h2> 
            <h3>Our goal is to deliver <em>SANITIZED</em> groceries to people in need around Loudoun County.</h3>
            <p><em>How can groceries be sanitized?</em></p>

            <p id="citation">"PSA Safe Grocery Shopping in COVID-19 Pandemic" by Dr. Jeffrey vanWingen</p>

            <p>It is imperative to disinfect all groceries. The Coronavirus can live on cardboard for up to one day, and up to three
             days on plastic. It is benefical to leave the groceries that are received in your garage for up to three days to make sure
             that COVID-19 does not come into your home. However, once you do bring in the groceries, make sure to disinfect the table
             you place them on.
            </p>

            <p>COVID-19 may have put our lives on halt, but basic necessities, such as groceries, should be accessible for 
             those people who have restrictions in getting these items for themselves. Our volunteers will practice social 
             distancing while delivering these groceries by maintaining a non-contact form of delivery. </p>
